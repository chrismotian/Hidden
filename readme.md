Hidden in the yachts by Christian

Description:
Game of chance/Picker game with a highscore.
The 9 choices will be awarded with fruits or ninjas.
Every round 3 picks are possible.
The bigger the fruit, the higher the score. 
If the ninja is the award the player (is lucky) gets all the points from the fruits and then everything gets doubled. If there are still picks available new fruits will be in the game and one new ninja.
After a round the score is fixed, if the score is higher than the highscore its a win and if not its a lose. 
The player can play a new round to beat his highscore.
